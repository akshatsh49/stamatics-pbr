# Physically-Based Rendering

A short course on pathtracing for Stamatics Projects '21

## Build Instructions

**Requirements:**
- C++ compiler
- CMake (get this via `pip` and not `apt` if you're on Ubuntu)

**Build:**

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

You should now have an executable in `build/bin` or `build/bin/Debug`
